# Start with a base image containing Java runtime
FROM openjdk:11-slim as build

# Add Maintainer Info

# The application's jar file set by dockerfile-maven-plugin

# Unpackage jar file
# Unpacks the app.jar copied previously into the filesystem of the build image
RUN mkdir -p target/dependency && (cd target/dependency; jar -xf /app.jar)

# Stage 2
# This second image contains the different layers of a Spring Boot app instead
# of the complete JAR file

# Same Java runtime
FROM openjdk:11-slim

# Add volume pointing to /tmp
VOLUME /tmp

# Copy unpackaged application to new container - copies the different layers from
